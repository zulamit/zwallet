## For Transparent Addresses Only

{{%notice note %}}
For a single account, it is easier to use the
scan sub account feature.

If you have funds in a legacy wallet (pre NU-5)
that hasn't been upgraded to support transaction V5,
your funds are inaccessible.

However, you can create an account in YWallet using
the same seed phrase and derivation path.

The resulting secret key and address will be identical
and you will be able to sweep your funds.

## Ledger

For Ledger, the derivation path is `m/44'/133'/0'/0/0`
For a second account in Ledger, the path is `m/44'/133'/1'/0/0`,
and so on.

If you have made several transactions, Ledger will have
created additional addresses by incrementing the final number:
`m/44'/133'/0'/0/1`, etc.

{{%notice note %}}
The exact format of the path is important. 
`m/44'/133'/0'/0/1` is not the same as `m/44/133'/0'/0/1`
Note the absence of `'` on 44.

You can use the website [Mnemonic Code Converter](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to check your addresses. *Don't forget to switch the currency to ZEC*.

## Path

Given `account_index` and `address_index`,
the path is typically:

`m/44'/133'/account_index'/0/address_index`

for wallets that follow the BIP-44 spec.

## How to

- Import an account using the seed phrase
- Switch to the account transparent address
- Long press on the QR code
- Enter the custom derivation path
- Check that the new transparent address matches what you expect

This feature is not compatible with the autoscan feature.

## Disclaimer

{{%notice warning %}}
Be advised that using your seed phrase online or in a hot
wallet compromises its security.
YWallet does not upload any data but your device may
be infected with malware that does. 
{{%/notice %}}

To mitigate the risks, sweep all the other funds from your hardware wallet to a new seed phrase and never use the old one.
