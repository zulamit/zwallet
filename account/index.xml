Each account has a shielded and transparent address (unless it was restored from a secret key).
An address has zero or more notes. For shielded accounts, notes are encrypted and only visible to the account owner. Transparent addresses have notes in cleartext.
A note is conceptually an &amp;ldquo;I Owe You&amp;rdquo;. It can have any amount greater than zero (including zero). The account balance is the sum of all the note amounts.</description></item><item><title>Account Manager</title><link>https://ywallet.app/account/manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/account/manager/</guid><description>Open the account manager by selecting &amp;ldquo;Accounts&amp;rdquo; in the app menu.

Fortunately, it is very easy to make a backup.
The account backup is the 24 words (in sequence) displayed on the Backup page (seed phrase)
When you create a new account, the app will show you the Backup page automatically.

This prevents you or anyone from spending from it. You will still be able to receive coins and monitor the balance.
Making an account watch-only is NOT reversible and you must have a backup of the seed phrase to restore the account later.
